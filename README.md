# gcp-pulumi-challenge-in-a-box

This repo contains the GCP version of Challenge in a Box (https://www.pulumi.com/challenge/startup-in-a-box/).

Currently *work in progress*. Status:

* ✅ Step 1
* ✅ Step 2
* ✅ Step 3
* ❌ Step 4
* ❌ Step 5
* ❌ Step 6
* ❌ Step 7

## Step 1. Your First Pulumi Program

You will learn how to create a new Pulumi program using our Pulumi templates,
specifically for `GCP` with TypeScript.

Create a new directory called `pulumi-challenge` and run the following inside of it:

    pulumi new gcp-typescript

## Step 2. Creating Your First Resource

Now that we have a base GCP project configured, we need to create our first resource.
In this instance, we’ll create a new GCS bucket which will allow us to store our static website.
We’ll also ensure that this bucket is private.

    TODO(): create Bucket code possibly using GCP Native library for `TS`.
    See 02-script.ts
